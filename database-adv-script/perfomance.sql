-- ALX Airbnb Database Module: Query Refactoring and Performance Optimization
-- ============================================================================
-- This script demonstrates query refactoring techniques to improve performance
-- by reducing unnecessary joins, optimizing WHERE clauses, and leveraging indexes
-- ============================================================================

-- ============================================================================
-- 📊 INITIAL COMPLEX QUERY: All Bookings with User, Property, and Payment Details
-- ============================================================================
-- This is the initial query that retrieves all bookings with related information
-- WARNING: This query is inefficient and will be refactored below
-- ============================================================================

-- INITIAL QUERY (INEFFICIENT - DO NOT USE IN PRODUCTION)
-- This query has multiple issues:
-- 1. Unnecessary columns selected (SELECT *)
-- 2. Multiple LEFT JOINs that may not all be needed
-- 3. No filtering or WHERE clause optimization
-- 4. No indexes utilized
-- 5. Potential for duplicate rows due to multiple JOINs

SELECT 
    b.id AS booking_id,
    b.user_id,
    u.id AS user_id_check,
    u.name AS user_name,
    u.email AS user_email,
    b.property_id,
    p.id AS property_id_check,
    p.title AS property_title,
    p.location AS property_location,
    b.status AS booking_status,
    COUNT(r.id) AS review_count,
    AVG(r.rating) AS avg_rating,
    COUNT(DISTINCT b.id) AS booking_count
FROM bookings b
LEFT JOIN users u ON b.user_id = u.id
LEFT JOIN properties p ON b.property_id = p.id
LEFT JOIN reviews r ON p.id = r.property_id
GROUP BY b.id, b.user_id, u.id, u.name, u.email, b.property_id, p.id, p.title, p.location, b.status
ORDER BY b.id DESC;

-- ============================================================================
-- ✅ REFACTORED QUERY 1: Separate Concerns (Recommended Approach)
-- ============================================================================
-- IMPROVEMENTS:
-- 1. Separated booking details from review aggregation
-- 2. Removed unnecessary GROUP BY on booking details
-- 3. Uses subquery for review aggregation (cleaner and more efficient)
-- 4. Leverages indexes on foreign keys
-- 5. Reduces JOIN complexity

ORDER BY b.id DESC
LIMIT 100;

-- ============================================================================
-- ✅ REFACTORED QUERY 4: Optimized for Specific Use Case (Location-Based)
-- ============================================================================
-- IMPROVEMENTS:
-- 1. Filters by property location (uses idx_properties_location)
-- 2. Reduces JOIN complexity by filtering early
-- 3. Uses composite indexes for better performance
-- 4. Includes date range filtering for time-based analysis
-- 5. Optimized for real-world use cases

ORDER BY rs.avg_rating DESC NULLS LAST
LIMIT 50;

-- ============================================================================
-- ✅ REFACTORED QUERY 5: Materialized View Approach (Best for Frequent Queries)

-- ============================================================================

-- ============================================================================
-- 🔧 OPTIMIZATION TECHNIQUES APPLIED
-- ============================================================================
-- 1. SEPARATE CONCERNS: Split complex queries into logical parts
-- 2. USE CTEs: Improve readability and query optimization
-- 3. ADD FILTERING: Use WHERE clauses to reduce result sets
-- 4. LEVERAGE INDEXES: Use indexed columns in JOINs and WHERE clauses
-- 5. AVOID UNNECESSARY JOINS: Only join tables that are needed
-- 6. USE SUBQUERIES: For aggregations that don't need to be in main result
-- 7. PAGINATION: Use LIMIT to reduce data transfer
-- 8. COLUMN SELECTION: Select only needed columns, not SELECT *
