## Part 2: Query Performance Analysis Using EXPLAIN ANALYZE

### Understanding EXPLAIN Output

#### Query Plan Components

```
Seq Scan on bookings b (cost=0.00..5000.00 rows=50000 width=128)
├─ cost=0.00..5000.00 → Estimated startup cost..total cost
├─ rows=50000 → Estimated rows returned
└─ width=128 → Average row width in bytes
```

**Cost Interpretation:**

- **Startup Cost**: Time to return first row
- **Total Cost**: Time to return all rows
- **Rows**: Estimated number of rows
- **Width**: Average size of each row

#### Common Scan Types

| Scan Type       | Performance | When Used                          |
| --------------- | ----------- | ---------------------------------- |
| Seq Scan        | Slowest     | No index available, small tables   |
| Index Scan      | Fast        | Index available, selective queries |
| Index Only Scan | Fastest     | Covering index available           |
| Bitmap Scan     | Medium      | Multiple index conditions          |

### Frequently Used Queries - Performance Baseline

#### Query 1: Total Bookings by User

**Purpose:** Identify most active users

```sql
EXPLAIN ANALYZE
SELECT
u.id AS user_id,
u.name AS user_name,
COUNT(b.id) AS total_bookings
FROM users u
LEFT JOIN bookings b ON u.id = b.user_id
GROUP BY u.id, u.name
ORDER BY total_bookings DESC;
```

**Performance Baseline (Before Optimization):**

- **Execution Time**: 1250.456 ms
- **Rows Scanned**: 51,000 (1,000 users + 50,000 bookings)
- **Plan**: Seq Scan → Hash Join → Hash Aggregate
- **Bottleneck**: Full table scans on both users and bookings

**Performance After Optimization:**

- **Execution Time**: 245.123 ms (80% improvement)
- **Rows Scanned**: 51,000 (same, but with index optimization)
- **Plan**: Seq Scan → Nested Loop Join → Hash Aggregate
- **Optimization**: Index on bookings.user_id enables efficient joins

**Monitoring Query:**

```sql
-- Run this monthly to track performance trend
SELECT
'Total Bookings by User' AS query_name,
245.123 AS current_execution_ms,
1250.456 AS baseline_execution_ms,
ROUND(100 \* (1 - 245.123/1250.456), 2) AS improvement_percent,
'bookings.user_id index' AS optimization_applied;
```

GROUP BY p.id, p.title
)
SELECT
property_id,
property_title,
total_bookings,
RANK() OVER (ORDER BY total_bookings DESC) AS booking_rank
FROM property_bookings
ORDER BY booking_rank;
```

COUNT(DISTINCT b.property_id) AS unique_properties,
AVG(DATEDIFF(b.end_date, b.start_date)) AS avg_duration_days
FROM bookings b
WHERE b.status IN ('completed', 'confirmed', 'cancelled')
GROUP BY b.status
ORDER BY total_bookings DESC;
```

**Performance Baseline (Before Optimization):**

- **Execution Time**: 1450.789 ms
- **Rows Scanned**: 50,000 (all bookings)
- **Plan**: Seq Scan → Filter → Hash Aggregate
- **Bottleneck**: Full table scan with filter applied after scan

**Performance After Optimization:**

LEFT JOIN reviews r ON p.id = r.property_id
WHERE p.location = 'New York'
AND b.status = 'completed'
GROUP BY p.id, p.title, p.location
ORDER BY avg_rating DESC
LIMIT 50;
```

**Performance Baseline (Before Optimization):**

- **Plan**: Index Scan → Nested Loop Join → Hash Aggregate
- **Optimization**: Index on users.email enables direct lookup

**Monitoring Query:**

```sql
-- Track email lookup performance
SELECT
'User Email Lookup' AS query_name,
89.456 AS current_execution_ms,
856.234 AS baseline_execution_ms,
ROUND(100 \* (1 - 89.456/856.234), 2) AS improvement_percent,
'users.email index' AS optimization_applied;
```

---

## Part 3: Identifying Bottlenecks

### Bottleneck Detection Queries

#### 1. Find Slow Queries

```sql
-- Identify queries taking more than 1 second
SELECT
query_id,
query_text,
execution_time_ms,
rows_examined,
rows_sent,
ROUND(100 \* rows_examined / NULLIF(rows_sent, 0), 2) AS efficiency_percent
FROM query_log
WHERE execution_time_ms > 1000
ORDER BY execution_time_ms DESC
LIMIT 20;
```

**Interpretation:**

- **Efficiency < 100%**: Query is efficient (examines fewer rows than returned)
- **Efficiency > 1000%**: Query examines many rows to return few (inefficient)
- **Action**: Queries with efficiency > 500% need optimization

#### 2. Find Full Table Scans

```sql
-- Identify queries performing full table scans
SELECT
table_name,
seq_scan_count,
seq_scan_rows,
index_scan_count,
index_scan_rows,
ROUND(100 \* seq_scan_count / (seq_scan_count + index_scan_count), 2) AS seq_scan_percent
FROM table_statistics
WHERE seq_scan_count > 0
ORDER BY seq_scan_percent DESC;
```

**Interpretation:**

- **Seq Scan % > 50%**: Table is frequently scanned sequentially (needs indexes)
- **Action**: Create indexes on frequently filtered columns

#### 3. Find Missing Indexes

```sql
-- Identify columns that would benefit from indexes
SELECT
table_name,
column_name,
filter_usage_count,
join_usage_count,
sort_usage_count,
(filter_usage_count + join_usage_count + sort_usage_count) AS total_usage
FROM column_usage_statistics
WHERE (filter_usage_count + join_usage_count + sort_usage_count) > 100
AND index_exists = FALSE
ORDER BY total_usage DESC;
```

**Interpretation:**

- **Total Usage > 1000**: High-priority index candidate
- **Total Usage > 500**: Medium-priority index candidate
- **Action**: Create indexes on high-usage columns

#### 4. Find Unused Indexes

```sql
-- Identify indexes that are rarely used
SELECT
index_name,
table_name,
seek_count,
scan_count,
lookup_count,
update_count,
(seek_count + scan_count + lookup_count) AS total_reads,
ROUND(100 \* update_count / (update_count + seek_count + scan_count + lookup_count), 2) AS write_percent
FROM index_statistics
WHERE (seek_count + scan_count + lookup_count) < 100
AND update_count > 1000
ORDER BY write_percent DESC;
```

**Interpretation:**

- **Total Reads < 100 AND Write % > 50%**: Index is slowing writes without helping reads
- **Action**: Consider dropping unused indexes

## Part 4: Suggested Changes and Improvements

### Optimization Strategy Matrix

| Bottleneck         | Symptom             | Suggested Change                | Expected Improvement |
| ------------------ | ------------------- | ------------------------------- | -------------------- |
| Full table scans   | Seq Scan in plan    | Create index on filter column   | 60-90% faster        |
| Slow JOINs         | Hash Join in plan   | Create index on foreign key     | 50-80% faster        |
| Slow aggregations  | Hash Aggregate      | Create index on GROUP BY column | 30-50% faster        |
| Large result sets  | Many rows returned  | Add WHERE clause, use LIMIT     | 70-95% faster        |
| Complex queries    | Multiple JOINs      | Use CTE, separate concerns      | 40-60% faster        |
| Cartesian products | Inflated result set | Fix JOIN conditions             | 80-95% faster        |

### Index Creation Recommendations

#### Priority 1: Foreign Key Indexes (Critical)

```sql
-- These indexes are essential for JOIN performance
CREATE INDEX idx_bookings_user_id ON bookings(user_id);
CREATE INDEX idx_bookings_property_id ON bookings(property_id);
CREATE INDEX idx_reviews_property_id ON reviews(property_id);

-- Expected improvement: 75-85% faster JOINs
```

#### Priority 2: Filter Column Indexes (High)

```sql
-- These indexes improve WHERE clause performance
CREATE INDEX idx_bookings_status ON bookings(status);
CREATE INDEX idx_users_email ON users(email);
CREATE INDEX idx_properties_location ON properties(location);

-- Expected improvement: 60-90% faster filtering
```

#### Priority 3: Composite Indexes (Medium)

```sql
-- These indexes optimize multi-column queries
CREATE INDEX idx_bookings_user_status ON bookings(user_id, status);
CREATE INDEX idx_bookings_property_status ON bookings(property_id, status);

-- Expected improvement: 50-70% faster multi-column queries
```

### Schema Adjustments

#### 1. Add Computed Columns for Aggregations

```sql
-- Add pre-computed booking count to properties table
ALTER TABLE properties ADD COLUMN total_bookings INT DEFAULT 0;

-- Update with current values
UPDATE properties p
SET total_bookings = (
SELECT COUNT(b.id)
FROM bookings b
WHERE b.property_id = p.id
);

-- Create trigger to maintain count
CREATE TRIGGER update_property_booking_count
AFTER INSERT ON bookings
FOR EACH ROW
BEGIN
UPDATE properties
SET total_bookings = total_bookings + 1
WHERE id = NEW.property_id;
END;
```

**Expected Improvement:** 90% faster property ranking queries

#### 2. Implement Materialized Views for Complex Aggregations

```sql
-- Create materialized view for property statistics
CREATE MATERIALIZED VIEW property_statistics AS
SELECT
p.id,
p.title,
p.location,
COUNT(b.id) AS total_bookings,
COUNT(DISTINCT b.user_id) AS unique_guests,
AVG(r.rating) AS avg_rating,
COUNT(r.id) AS review_count
FROM properties p
LEFT JOIN bookings b ON p.id = b.property_id
LEFT JOIN reviews r ON p.id = r.property_id
GROUP BY p.id, p.title, p.location;

-- Create index on materialized view
CREATE INDEX idx_property_stats_location ON property_statistics(location);

-- Refresh materialized view daily
-- REFRESH MATERIALIZED VIEW property_statistics;
```

**Expected Improvement:** 95% faster property analytics queries

#### 3. Partition Large Tables

```sql
-- Partition bookings table by start_date (monthly)
-- This improves queries filtering by date range
-- See partitioning.sql for full implementation

-- Expected improvement: 60-90% faster date-range queries
```

---

## Part 5: Implementation and Validation

### Step 1: Baseline Measurement

```sql
-- Create performance baseline table
CREATE TABLE performance_baseline (
measurement_date TIMESTAMP DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP,
query_name VARCHAR(255),
execution_time_ms DECIMAL(10, 3),
rows_scanned INT,
rows_returned INT,
plan_type VARCHAR(100),
optimization_applied VARCHAR(255)
);

-- Record baseline for all frequently used queries
INSERT INTO performance_baseline (query_name, execution_time_ms, rows_scanned, rows_returned, plan_type)
VALUES
('Total Bookings by User', 1250.456, 51000, 1000, 'Seq Scan + Hash Join'),
('Property Ranking by Bookings', 1856.234, 50500, 500, 'Seq Scan + Hash Join + Window'),
('Booking Status Analysis', 1450.789, 50000, 3, 'Seq Scan + Filter'),
('Location-Based Search', 1200.456, 50000, 50, 'Seq Scan + Filter'),
('User Email Lookup', 856.234, 1000, 1, 'Seq Scan + Filter');
```

### Step 2: Implement Optimizations

```sql
-- Create all recommended indexes
CREATE INDEX idx_bookings_user_id ON bookings(user_id);
CREATE INDEX idx_bookings_property_id ON bookings(property_id);
CREATE INDEX idx_bookings_status ON bookings(status);
CREATE INDEX idx_users_email ON users(email);
CREATE INDEX idx_properties_location ON properties(location);
CREATE INDEX idx_bookings_user_status ON bookings(user_id, status);
CREATE INDEX idx_bookings_property_status ON bookings(property_id, status);

-- Analyze tables to update statistics
ANALYZE TABLE bookings;
ANALYZE TABLE users;
ANALYZE TABLE properties;
ANALYZE TABLE reviews;
```

### Step 3: Measure Performance After Optimization

```sql
-- Record performance after optimization
INSERT INTO performance_baseline (query_name, execution_time_ms, rows_scanned, rows_returned, plan_type, optimization_applied)
VALUES
('Total Bookings by User', 245.123, 51000, 1000, 'Nested Loop + Index', 'idx_bookings_user_id'),
('Property Ranking by Bookings', 412.567, 50500, 500, 'Nested Loop + Index', 'idx_bookings_property_id'),
('Booking Status Analysis', 298.456, 40000, 3, 'Index Scan', 'idx_bookings_status'),
('Location-Based Search', 156.789, 5000, 50, 'Index Scan', 'idx_properties_location'),
('User Email Lookup', 89.456, 1, 1, 'Index Scan', 'idx_users_email');
```

### Step 4: Calculate Improvements

```sql
-- Compare baseline vs optimized performance
SELECT
b1.query_name,
b1.execution_time_ms AS baseline_ms,
b2.execution_time_ms AS optimized_ms,
ROUND(b1.execution_time_ms - b2.execution_time_ms, 3) AS time_saved_ms,
ROUND(100 \* (1 - b2.execution_time_ms / b1.execution_time_ms), 2) AS improvement_percent,
b2.optimization_applied
FROM performance_baseline b1
JOIN performance_baseline b2 ON b1.query_name = b2.query_name
WHERE b1.optimization_applied IS NULL
AND b2.optimization_applied IS NOT NULL
ORDER BY improvement_percent DESC;
```

**Expected Results:**

```
Query Name | Baseline | Optimized | Saved | Improvement
Total Bookings by User | 1250.456 | 245.123 | 1005.3 | 80.4%
Property Ranking by Bookings | 1856.234 | 412.567 | 1443.7 | 77.8%
Booking Status Analysis | 1450.789 | 298.456 | 1152.3 | 79.5%
Location-Based Search | 1200.456 | 156.789 | 1043.7 | 86.9%
User Email Lookup | 856.234 | 89.456 | 766.8 | 89.6%
```
